**Abstract**
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Design &amp; Architecture for simplistic understanding and modeling
As the field of Machine Learning (ML) becomes increasingly more popular around the field of Computer Science, there are simply not enough people who are willing or even have the slightest idea of what ML is all about.

Imagine a domain where anyone of any age can easily enter this site and be able to understand how Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) work without involving any of the math and strictly relying on a visual representation on how data is processed through a Neural Network (NN).

The concept and diagram of an NN are simple to interpret. Using a simple UI, The user (with no knowledge of Computer Science) would be able to design their own NN (Imagine a drag n drop feature) and feed the algorithm some input data and be able to observe exactly how an image (for example) is then interpreted by a computer, visually.

As a result, a person at the age of 12 who has no knowledge about computers whatsoever would be able to create their own ANN that could solve a multitude of problems without having to know any of the math (if they wish)

My goal is to express this field to a variety of people since this is a hot topic in Computer Science today. Excitement is what gets people motivated to learn more in-depth - this project would be a starting point for that excitement.
