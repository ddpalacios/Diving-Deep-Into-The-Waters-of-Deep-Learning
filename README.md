Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Design &amp; Architecture for simplistic understanding and modeling

**Abstract**

---

As Machine Learning (ML) becomes increasingly more popular around the field of Computer Science, there are simply not enough people who are willing or even have the slightest idea of what ML is all about. 

Imagine a domain where anyone of any age can easily enter this site and be able to understand how Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) work without relying on complex formulas. However, The concept and diagram of an NN are simple to interpret. Diving Deep into The Waters of Deep Learning is an application that relies on a visual representation of how data is processed through a Neural Network (NN).

Using a simple user-interface, the user (with no knowledge of Computer Science) would be able to design their own NN and feed their model input data which would then be able to observe exactly how the data was then interpreted by a computer, visually. As a result, a person at the age of 12 (for example) who does not know computers whatsoever would be able to create their own ANN that could solve a multitude of problems without having too many complications. 

My goal is to express this field to a variety of people since this is a hot topic in Computer Science today. Excitement is what gets people motivated to learn more in-depth - this web application would be a starting point for that excitement.

**Motivation**

---
The motivation for Diving Deeps layout design comes from the existing application that is named
Neural  Network  Playground  for  Tensorflow.   From  looking  at  figure  1,  this  existing  application
allows  the  manipulation  of  the  NN  attributes  and  the  augmentation  of  its  topology  to  design
further complex models.  By playing around with its values and tuning, when the user hits play
there is a visual graph on how the current set model solves its dataset by separating data points
by individual classes. 


**Drag n Drop**

Here is a good example of previous repository from ==> https://github.com/kofmangregory/Drag-and-Drop-Deep-Learning.git

In these images, we see that the UI has block features that represent individual features for a given layer and from here we can then export this model and the application will save a .py file of a KERAS implemented model of your design. 

**Frontend:**

**Output Python file:**

We want to be able to make this a bit more flexiable... This application does not give the user a simple drag n drop as it still faces certain limitations when wanting to build bigger or more complex models, we need to be able to use those features when needed. 

**Things to take note:**

- Drag n Drop is a good implementation to use. It creates entertainment and flexibility for the user.

- We also need to give our application the needed features in order to generate complex models

- Lastly, we need to render our model to visualize and train


For visualization, there exists a neural network playground for Tensorflow that allows these extra features to design further complex models in comparison to our first repository. 


**Output Python file:**

This is a great application for designing complex models however, this does not provide drang n drop implementations. We want to be able to combine a simple drag n drop UI as well as have complexity in our models.
