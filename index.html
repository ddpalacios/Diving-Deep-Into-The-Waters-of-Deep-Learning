<h1>Welcome to the official Neural Network playground.</h1>

  <h3> The concept and diagram of an NN are simple to interpret.  <br>
    Using a simple UI, The user (with no knowledge of Computer Science)  <br>
    would be able to design their own NN (Imagine a drag n drop feature)  <br>
    and feed the algorithm some input data and be able to observe exactly  <br>
    how an image (for example) is then interpreted by a computer, visually. <br>
    As a result, a person at the age of 12 who has no knowledge about computers  <br>
    whatsoever would be able to create their own ANN that could solve a multitude  <br>
    of problems without having to know any of the math (if they wish) <br>
    <br>  My goal is to express this field to a variety of people since this is a hot topic in Computer Science today. <br>
    <br>Excitement is what gets people motivated to learn more in-depth - this is the the starting point for that excitement.  </h3>
